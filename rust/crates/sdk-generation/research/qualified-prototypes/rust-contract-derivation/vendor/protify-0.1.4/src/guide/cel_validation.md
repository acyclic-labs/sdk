# Cel Validation

The `cel` feature unlocks [CEL](https://cel.dev/)-based validation, which can be very handy for making validators portable.

If a CEL expressions fails to compile, **it will cause a panic**, so it is strongly advised to test each expression to avoid surprises at runtime.

Unless manually disabled, these checks are automatically performed in the macros' output, as explained in the [`correctness`](crate::guide::correctness) section.

## Reusing Programs

Each [`CelProgram`](crate::CelProgram) instance wraps a CEL expression that is compiled and initialized once, and reused after that.
The wrapper itself holds an [`Arc`](std::sync::Arc) and is therefore cheap to clone.

If a program is used in different places, it's a good idea to initialize it once and then clone it.

This crate exports a `Lazy` struct that can be used for this purpose, which is a type alias for [`LazyLock`](std::sync::LazyLock) when the `std` feature is enabled, and otherwise implements a wrapper for [`OnceBox`](once_cell::race::OnceBox) that also initializes at the first deref.

### Example

```rust
use protify::*;

proto_package!(MY_PKG, name = "my_pkg");
define_proto_file!(MY_FILE, name = "my_file.proto", package = MY_PKG);

// The program is compiled once and then wrapped in an Arc, so it can be cheaply cloned
static REUSABLE_PROGRAM: Lazy<CelProgram> = Lazy::new(|| {
	cel_program!(
		id = "my_prog",
		msg = "error_message",
		expr = "this.location == 'Isengard'"
	)
});

#[proto_message]
pub struct TheyAreTakingTheHobbitsTo {
	pub location: String,
}

#[proto_message]
pub struct ABalrogOfMorgoth {
	// Here we are just cloning an Arc pointer to the lazily initialized program,
	// not the program itself
	#[proto(message, validate = |v| v.cel(REUSABLE_PROGRAM.clone()))]
	pub what_did_you_say: Option<TheyAreTakingTheHobbitsTo>,
}

#[proto_message]
pub struct TellMeWhereIsGandalf {
	#[proto(message, validate = |v| v.cel(REUSABLE_PROGRAM.clone()))]
	pub for_i_much_desire_to_speak_with_him: Option<TheyAreTakingTheHobbitsTo>,
}
```

# Enforcing Unique IDs

The instances of [`Package`](crate::Package) provide methods with which to ensure that there aren't rules with the same ID in the same message scope, which is a good practice to avoid ambiguity. Refer to the [`correctness`](crate::guide::correctness) section or the [`proto_package`](crate::proto_package) documentation for more details about that.
