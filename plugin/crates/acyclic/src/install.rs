//! `acyclic install <host>` — wires one host's adapter into the current repo.
//!
//! Two adapter shapes. Hook-based hosts (claude-code, codex, cursor) get
//! lifecycle-hook config that calls `acyclic hook <event>` around every
//! edit and command, plus the commands/skills/rules that teach the agent
//! the verbs; all of it is checked-in, so the whole team inherits it.
//! MCP-based hosts (claude-desktop, vscode; cursor gets both) have no hook
//! API, so they get `acyclic mcp` (see `crate::mcp`) registered as an MCP
//! server in whatever config file that host reads — project-scoped and
//! checked in where the host supports it, the user's global config where
//! it doesn't. The agents-md adapter gives shell-capable hosts a cheatsheet
//! block in AGENTS.md and no hooks.
//!
//! Each `HostAdapter` below documents exactly what its host gets. The
//! README's per-host table is the user-facing version of the same list,
//! with how far each adapter has been verified.

// (claude_desktop/cursor/vscode) — generalize to most other coding-agent
// CLIs and desktop apps, not just the ones below. Before adding one:
// 1. Find its hook config (file, event names, payload shape) and/or its MCP
//    config (file location, JSON vs TOML, top-level key, whether `type` is
//    explicit) from its own current docs — don't assume it matches an
//    existing adapter; VS Code alone differs from Claude Desktop/Cursor on
//    both the key name and the explicit-type requirement.
// 2. Prefer the MCP path when the config is JSON-shaped and matches (or is
//    close to) `McpConfigShape` — reuse `merge_mcp_server_json`, add a
//    shape constant, a `Host` variant, and its arm in `run`, the same
//    pattern as `vscode`.
// 3. Write the merge, add a unit test seeding an existing config to prove
//    other entries survive and a second install is idempotent (see
//    `vscode_install_writes_project_scoped_mcp_config`), then verify against
//    the real app before calling it more than "built."
// Concrete candidates, not yet done:
// - Kimi Code CLI: has BOTH lifecycle hooks (`[[hooks]]` in config.toml —
//   TOML again, like Codex) and MCP support (`kimi mcp` subcommands /
//   `/mcp-config`); unclear yet which config file MCP entries land in or
//   its exact JSON/TOML shape — check `kimi mcp` docs before writing.
// - Windsurf, Zed, JetBrains AI assistants, Gemini CLI, Amazon Q Developer:
//   unresearched. Likely MCP-capable (most 2026-era agent tools are) but
//   config location/shape unverified — do not assume any of them match
//   Claude Desktop/Cursor's shape without checking.

const REWIND_COMMAND: &str = r#"---
description: Restore the working tree to an earlier checkpoint (untracked and gitignored files included)
---

Restore this repo to an earlier {{name}} checkpoint. Follow exactly:

1. Run `{{name}} timeline` and show the user the recent checkpoints.
2. Ask which checkpoint to restore (or confirm if they already named one:
   $ARGUMENTS).
3. Run `{{name}} rewind <id> --yes`.
4. Run `cd "$PWD"` in your shell. A rewind swaps the repo directory, and a
   shell that stays in the old inode silently runs every later command in
   the replaced tree.
5. Tell the user: the tree is restored exactly (including generated and
   gitignored files); a safety checkpoint of the pre-rewind state was taken
   automatically; and they should reload their editor, since open buffers
   still show the replaced tree.
6. Do not run any other write operations until the rewind completes.
"#;

const TIMELINE_COMMAND: &str = r#"---
description: Show the repo's history as conversation turns, diff what a turn changed, or restore one file from an earlier point
---

Answer the user's history question with {{name}}'s timeline. Request:
$ARGUMENTS

Pick the matching step:

- "What happened / what did each turn do": run `{{name}} turns` (add
  `--session <id>` for an older session from `{{name}} sessions`) and
  summarize which prompt led to which checkpoints.
- "What did turn N change" or "what did approach X look like": run
  `{{name}} diff --turn N` and list the files; for an abandoned attempt the
  session brief names its checkpoint range, so `{{name}} diff <a> <b>`.
- "Why did file X change": run `{{name}} timeline --limit 200`, then
  `{{name}} show <id>` on the checkpoint after the change to get the turn
  and the prompt that caused it.
- "Bring back just file X from earlier": `{{name}} restore <id> <path>`.
  Only that path changes; the rest of the tree is untouched. Tell the user
  a checkpoint recorded the restore, so it is itself undoable.

Never guess at history from memory when the timeline can answer exactly.

const SELF_ROLLBACK_SKILL: &str = r#"---
name: {{name}}-self-rollback
description: Use {{name}} checkpoints to try risky changes safely - checkpoint before an attempt, rewind cleanly on failure instead of hand-reverting, and show a blast-radius diff before finishing. Use when a task is risky (migrations, refactors, codegen, dependency changes), when a failed attempt needs undoing, or before declaring multi-file work done.
---

# Self-rollback with {{name}}

This repo checkpoints automatically around your tool calls (an {{name}}
daemon snapshots the working tree, including untracked and gitignored
files). You can also use it deliberately:

## Before a risky attempt
Run `{{name}} checkpoint --wait -m "before <attempt>"`. Note the printed
checkpoint id.

## When an attempt fails
Do NOT hand-revert edits (more edits poison the tree). Instead:
1. `{{name}} timeline` - find the checkpoint from before the attempt.
2. `{{name}} rewind <id> --yes` - the tree is back exactly, including
   generated files and Bash side effects.
3. Try the next approach from the clean state.

## Before declaring work done
Run `{{name}} diff --stat` and review the blast radius: every file the
session changed, including what scripts and generators wrote. Mention
anything unexpected to the user.

## History across the conversation
Every checkpoint is linked to the conversation turn (prompt) that caused
it, and history survives across sessions:
- `{{name}} turns` - which prompt led to which checkpoints.
- `{{name}} diff --turn N` - exactly what turn N changed.
- `{{name}} show <id>` - a checkpoint's session, turn, and prompt.
- `{{name}} restore <id> <path>` - bring back ONE file from any checkpoint
  (an earlier abandoned approach, say) without touching the rest.
The session-start brief in your context names the previous session's end
checkpoint and any abandoned branches; use their ids directly.

## Rules
- After ANY `{{name}} rewind` or `{{name}} promote`, run `cd "$PWD"` before
  the next command. Both swap the repo directory; a shell left in the old
  inode silently operates on the replaced tree.
- Rewind restores file contents and modes, not mtimes: expect rebuilds.
- Paths listed under `exclude` in .{{name}}/config.toml (secrets, bulky
  generated state) are never checkpointed: a rewind leaves them exactly
  as they are now, and `{{name}} restore` refuses them. Do not rely on a
  checkpoint to undo an edit to an excluded file.
- After a rewind, the user's editor may show stale buffers - say so.
- If `{{name}}` reports the daemon is not running, checkpointing is off;
  tell the user to run `{{name}} init` rather than working around it.

const FORK_COMMAND: &str = r#"---
description: Race N approaches to a task in isolated forks and land the winner, or run one risky step in a fork first

Use the {{name}}-fork-decompose skill for this request. Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Parse the arguments for parameter overrides in the form `key=value`
(fan_out, max_depth, max_forks, require_tests, test_command, tie_break);
everything else is the task. Run `{{name}} policy` for the defaults, apply
the overrides, and state the effective parameters in one line before
forking.

const FORK_DECOMPOSE_SKILL: &str = r#"---
name: {{name}}-fork-decompose
description: Solve a large or uncertain task with isolated {{name}} forks - race alternative approaches and land one winner, partition independent parts across forks and land them all, or prove a risky step in a fork before it touches the real tree. Use when two or more designs are plausible, when a task splits into parts that touch different files, or when the user runs /fork. Not for small edits: checkpoint and do those in place.
---

# Fork decomposition with {{name}}

You are the ROOT agent in the real repository. Only the root can fork.
Subagents work inside fork directories and NEVER run `{{name}}`. Recursion
is you repeating ROUND: fork, race, promote one, re-fork from the new tree.

## 0. Parameters (read first, every time)

Run `{{name}} policy`. It prints:

```
fan_out = N          forks per race
max_depth = N        rounds before you must check in with the user
max_forks = N        total forks for this task
require_tests = bool a fork can win only if its tests pass
test_command = ...   command each subagent runs, or "(infer from the repo)"
tie_break = ...      "smallest-diff" | "first-passing" | "ask-user"
```

`/fork` arguments of the form `key=value` override these. State the
effective values in ONE line before the first fork, e.g.
`fork policy: fan_out=3 max_depth=2 max_forks=8 tests=required tie=smallest-diff`.

## 1. Decide ONCE, locally: DO, RACE, PARTITION, or SEQUENCE

- **DO** — one obvious approach, or a handful of edits. Run
  `{{name}} checkpoint -m "before <task>"` and work in the real tree.
  If unsure, prefer DO. Rewind already makes a wrong turn cheap; a fork
  must beat rewind, not beat nothing.
- **RACE** — one goal, 2 or more genuinely different approaches, and a
  wrong choice would be expensive. Fork `fan_out` ways, one approach each,
  land ONE.
- **PARTITION** — independent parts. Fork one per part, land EVERY
  passing fork. Promote merges each fork onto the moved mainline: paths
  only that fork touched are written in place ("promoted by replay"), and
  a file both sides edited is merged three-way by content ("promoted by
  merge"). Only edits to the SAME LINES conflict: the promote then writes
  conflict markers into that fork and lands nothing; resolve them in the
  fork and promote again. ADJACENT lines count as the same region (a
  three-way merge cannot split one hunk), so a list of bullets or a
  block of imports is one region: give it to one fork. Assign ownership
  by file, or by region of a shared file, in each child prompt so
  conflicts stay rare. Edits other parts depend on (a type, an
  interface, a config key) go first as a SEQUENCE step, then partition
  the rest. Gitignored files (bytecode caches, build output, .env) never
  conflict: the mainline keeps its own copy and promote says so.
- **SEQUENCE** — several dependent steps where a later step must not start
  until an earlier one is proven. One fork per step, promote, re-fork.

## 2. One ROUND

Depth starts at 1 and increases by one per round.

1. `{{name}} fork -n <fan_out>`. It records the fork base as a checkpoint
   itself, so do not checkpoint first. Note each id and mounted path.
2. Dispatch ALL subagents in one turn, one per fork, using the CHILD
   PROMPT below. Do not keep one approach for yourself.
3. **Freeze.** Make NO edits to the real tree while forks are live. A
   real-tree edit merges like another fork would: fine when disjoint,
   a conflict to resolve when it touches the same lines.
4. When all reports are in: RACE only, `{{name}} fork-diff <id>` for each
   candidate, in ONE shell call, for the SELECTION RULE. PARTITION: skip
   fork-diff; the child report lists the files and promote prints what
   landed.
5. RACE: pick the winner by the SELECTION RULE and `{{name}} promote <winner>`.
   PARTITION: ONE call, `{{name}} promote <id> <id> ...`, every fork that
   passed, in dispatch order. It lands them one after another and prints
   one line per fork. Every promote writes the fork's paths into the real
   tree in place; the repo directory is never replaced.
6. Read each fork's line: `promoted` / `promoted by merge` landed;
   `N file(s) conflict` wrote markers into that fork (see section 6) and
   the other forks still landed.
7. `{{name}} fork-drop <id>` for every fork you will not land, in one
   shell call, immediately.
8. Report the round in the ROUND REPORT shape.
9. If work remains and depth < max_depth and forks used < max_forks,
   start the next round from the promoted tree. Otherwise stop and
   report to the user.

## 3. CHILD PROMPT (copy exactly, fill the angle brackets)

```
You are working in an isolated fork of the repository at:
  <absolute fork path>
Use ONLY absolute paths under that directory. Do not cd elsewhere. Do not
run any `{{name}}` command: this directory is a fork, not the repository.
Do not read or write the real repository at <absolute repo root>.

GOAL: <one sentence, verbatim from the task>
YOUR APPROACH (<kebab-case-id>): <one or two sentences naming this
approach and what makes it different from the alternatives>
YOU OWN: <PARTITION only: the files, directories, or regions of a shared
file this fork may change; touch nothing else, or your promote will
conflict with a sibling's>
DEPTH: <depth> of <max_depth>

Do the work. Make your first tool call a write to the file you own most.
Before reporting, run the tests with the fork directory as the working
directory, e.g. `cd <absolute fork path> && <test_command>`:
  <test_command, or: infer the project's test command and run it>

Reply with exactly this shape and nothing else:

## APPROACH: <kebab-case-id>
### RESULT: PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL
### TESTS: <command run> -> <pass/fail count or "not run: reason">
### FILES: <one path per line, absolute path stripped to repo-relative>
### RISKS: <one line each, or "none">
### RECOMMEND: <one line: land | drop | needs <what>>
```

## 4. SELECTION RULE

1. Discard any fork whose RESULT is FAIL, and any with RESULT PARTIAL
   unless every fork is PARTIAL.
2. If `require_tests` is true, discard any fork whose TESTS did not pass.
3. If none remain: drop all forks, run ONE more round with the failures
   named in each child's approach text, then stop and report. Never
   promote a partial without saying so in the report.
4. If several remain, apply `tie_break`:
   - `smallest-diff`: fewest paths in `{{name}} fork-diff`, not counting
     `m` (metadata) lines or `(gitignored)` lines, then fewest RISKS.
   - `first-passing`: the first fork id in dispatch order that passed.
   - `ask-user`: show each candidate's fork-diff and RISKS, ask, wait.
5. A fork must be clearly better than doing nothing. If the winner's
   fork-diff is empty, drop it and treat the round as DO.

## 5. ROUND REPORT (to the user, after every round)

```
round <depth>/<max_depth> · <goal>
  winner  <id> <approach-id>  tests <result>  <N> paths
  dropped <id> <approach-id>  <one-line reason>
  (one dropped line per loser)
  forks used <n>/<max_forks>
```

After the final round: `{{name}} diff <first checkpoint> <latest>` and
summarise the blast radius, ignoring `m` (metadata-only) lines. Mention
anything a script or generator wrote.

## 6. Failure handling

- A promote that reports `N file(s) conflict` has written conflict
  markers into THAT FORK (the mainline is untouched) and moved the fork
  onto the current tree. Open each named file in the fork, resolve every
  `<<<<<<<` / `|||||||` / `=======` / `>>>>>>>` block (the middle block is
  the original), leave no markers, then `{{name}} promote <id>` again. A
  `(deleted)` label means one side deleted the file: keep it without
  markers or delete it. `unresolved conflict markers` means a block is
  still there.
- A promote that says paths `cannot be merged` (binary, too large, a kind
  change, a directory deleted on one side and changed inside on the
  other) cannot be resolved in place: one fork must own that path. The
  fork is untouched; re-fork from the current tree and redo that part
  with tighter ownership.
- `{{name}} forks` says none are live after a daemon restart: every fork is
  lost. Re-run the round; nothing was landed.
- `{{name}} fork` fails with a mounts error: read `{{name}} status`, tell the
  user what it says, and fall back to DO.
- Two rounds in a row with no winner: stop and ask the user.

## Quick decision reference

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| One obvious approach, or a handful of edits | DO |
| 2+ genuinely different designs, expensive to guess wrong | RACE |
| Dependent steps, each must be proven first | SEQUENCE |
| Independent parts, different files | PARTITION |
| Independent parts that share a file, different regions | PARTITION; the merge is line-level |
| Independent parts that share lines, or a type/interface others use | SEQUENCE that edit first, then PARTITION |
| depth == max_depth and work remains | Stop, report, ask |
| forks used == max_forks | Stop, report, ask |
| Winner's fork-diff is empty | Drop it; the round was DO |

## {{name}} checkpoints

This repo uses {{name}}: the working tree (untracked + gitignored files
included) is snapshotted by a local daemon. Useful commands:

    {{name}} checkpoint --wait -m "msg"   snapshot now, note the id
    {{name}} timeline                     recent checkpoints
    {{name}} rewind <id> --yes            restore the tree exactly
    {{name}} diff --stat                  everything changed this session
    {{name}} turns                        which prompt caused which checkpoints
    {{name}} diff --turn N                what one conversation turn changed
    {{name}} restore <id> <path>          bring back one file, leave the rest
    {{name}} brief                        where the previous session ended
    {{name}} summary --turn N             what one turn did, in prose (only
                                          when speculation is on; see README)

Before a risky change, checkpoint. After a failed attempt, rewind instead
of hand-reverting. Before finishing, review `{{name}} diff`. Paths under
`exclude` in .{{name}}/config.toml are never checkpointed; a rewind leaves
them untouched.

## Splitting work across isolated forks

A fork is a writable copy-on-write view of the tree, cut in well under a
second however large the repo. Work inside one is invisible to the real
tree until you promote it.

    {{name}} policy                  the decomposition limits for this repo
    {{name}} fork -n N               cut N forks; each prints its path
    {{name}} fork-diff <id>          what one fork changed, before landing it
    {{name}} promote <id> [<id>...]  land those forks into the real tree, in order
    {{name}} fork-drop <id>          discard it; its changes evaporate
    {{name}} forks                   what is live right now

Read `{{name}} policy` first and stay inside its limits. Then pick ONE:

- **DO** - one obvious approach, or a handful of edits. Checkpoint and work
  in the real tree. If unsure, prefer this: a fork must beat rewind, not
  beat nothing.
- **PARTITION** - independent parts touching different files. One fork per
  part, promote every fork that passed.
- **RACE** - one goal, 2+ genuinely different designs, expensive to guess
  wrong. One fork per approach, land exactly one.
- **SEQUENCE** - dependent steps. One fork per step, promote, re-fork.

Rules that are easy to get wrong:

- **Never fork a step that cannot be parallelised.** A summary, a merge, a
  reconciliation or a final ranking has no alternatives to race and nothing
  to split - forking it only adds coordination. Do it yourself.
- **Give each fork enough work to be worth it.** Coordination costs roughly
  a fixed amount per fork; if a fork's share is smaller than that, you are
  slower than doing it serially.
- **Freeze while forks are live.** Do not edit the real tree; a real-tree
  edit merges like another fork would.
- **Subagents never run `{{name}}`.** They work inside their fork directory
  by absolute path. Only you fork, promote and drop.
- A promote reporting `N file(s) conflict` wrote diff3 markers into THAT
  FORK and landed nothing. Resolve them there, then promote again.
