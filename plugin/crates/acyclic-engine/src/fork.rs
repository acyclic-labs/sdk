//! Fork engine primitives (Launch 3).
//!
//! A fork is a writable overlay mount of a Head checkout: reads hydrate
//! lazily from the store (O(1) creation, `node_modules` included), writes
//! accumulate in that checkout's private overlay — invisible to the real
//! tree and to every other fork. The pipeline mints fork checkouts (it owns
//! the volume); the daemon owns the mount sessions (they must live in the
//! long-lived process).
//!
//! When the host has no mount provider (no usable `/dev/fuse` on Linux, or
//! loopback NFS blocked on macOS) a fork degrades to a *copy*: the base
//! generation is materialized into a real directory, and at promote time
//! that directory is captured back into the fork's overlay so the same
//! commit, conflict check, and swap run unchanged. The promise a fork makes
//! — a writable tree that never touches the real one until promoted — holds
//! either way; only the O(1) creation cost is lost.
