# CI guard for the code-quality rules clippy and rustfmt can't express.
# Cheap, dependency-free except for the duplication check, which needs node
# (skipped with a notice when node is absent, never silently).
#
# Rules, each with the reason it exists:
#   1. Line length: rustfmt wraps code at 100 but leaves string literals and
#      comments alone, so a 200-column format string or comment sails
#      through `cargo fmt --check`. Rust: 120, except the YAML frontmatter
#      lines inside the embedded command/skill templates (`description:`),
#      which are data a host reads verbatim. Shell: 200 (acceptance prompts
#      are long by nature).
#   2. TODO format: a TODO with no owner or topic is a TODO nobody picks up.
#      Comment lines must write `TODO(topic):` / `FIXME(topic):`. Strings
#      are not checked (test fixtures legitimately contain the word).
#   3. Comment-block length: a comment longer than 30 consecutive lines is
#      usually a design note that belongs in docs/design/, or an
#      explanation of code that should instead be simpler. Split it or
#      move it. (Usage headers on scripts sit just under the cap.)
#   4. Duplication: jscpd over Rust and shell, failing when more than 3% of
#      tokens are clones (baseline when this landed: 2.4%, almost all
#      acceptance-test setup). Copy-pasted match arms and helpers were the
#      recurring review finding this guards against.
