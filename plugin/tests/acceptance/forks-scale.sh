# Fork scale measurement (docs/design/03-forks.md, spec-forks.md).
#
# forks.sh proves the contract at N=3; this asks whether the routed design
# holds into the hundreds. Three claims, all load-bearing for the fan-out
# story (N subagents on N forks):
#
#   C1 (one mount)  — exactly 1 kernel mount at every rung; forks are route
#                     inserts, not mounts (spec-forks.md).
#   C2 (O(1) store) — per-fork store growth is fixed overhead, not a
#                     function of tree size.
#   C3 (flat cost)  — route insert #256 costs about what #1 did.
#
# A measurement tool first, a pass/fail test second: the rung table prints
# on every run because the numbers are the point, and the budgets are loose
# enough to catch only a blowup (C3 allows 4x drift).
#
# `fork -n` is capped at 16 (crates/acyclic/src/server.rs), so N forks come
# from ceil(N/16) calls, each publishing its own base. The rungs are
# therefore not a single-base fan-out, though nothing edits the mainline
# during the ladder so cost and isolation still measure faithfully. Raising
# that cap and setting ACYCLIC_SCALE_BATCH measures the single-call path.
#
#   ACYCLIC_SCALE_RUNGS    ladder (default "16 64 256"; 1024 for the full
#                          run, where fd limits complain first)
#   ACYCLIC_SCALE_BATCH    forks per `fork -n` call (default 16 = the cap)
#   ACYCLIC_SCALE_REQUIRED 1 = fail instead of skip when mounts are absent
