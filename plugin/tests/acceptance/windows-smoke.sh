# Windows end-to-end smoke: the paths that are platform-specific enough to
# break silently there, driven through the real CLI and daemon.
#
# The rest of the acceptance suite assumes a POSIX host (mount tooling,
# symlinks, modes) and is not claimed to run here. This script covers what
# Windows actually changes:
#
#   - the named-pipe transport, including a client whose stdout is a pipe
#     (a daemon that inherits it never lets the caller see EOF)
#   - capture and diff under UTF-16LE names, non-ASCII included
#   - rewind, which renames the repo root and so trips every open handle
#   - copy-mode forks and promote, the fork path Windows actually uses
#
# Runs under Git Bash on a GitHub windows runner. ACYCLIC_BIN overrides the
# binary (default: target/release/acyclic.exe).
